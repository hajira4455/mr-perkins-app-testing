### npm/yarn installation warnings

---

<p>
  You might get some warnings while running <code>npm install</code> or <code>yarn install</code> like below:
</p>

```bash
info fsevents@2.3.1: The platform "win32" is incompatible with this module.
info "fsevents@2.3.1" is an optional dependency and failed compatibility check. Excluding it from installation.
info fsevents@1.2.13: The platform "win32" is incompatible with this module.
info "fsevents@1.2.13" is an optional dependency and failed compatibility check. Excluding it from installation.
[3/4] Linking dependencies...
warning " > @uppy/react@1.11.2" has unmet peer dependency "@uppy/core@^1.0.0".
warning "@uppy/react > @uppy/file-input@1.4.22" has unmet peer dependency "@uppy/core@^1.0.0".
```

<p>The warnings you are receiving while installing is from library/packages we used.</p>

<p>
  We always keep our packages up to date when we make major release. However, the writer of that package may use an
  older dependency that is no longer maintained for backward compatibility or any other code related issue. But, that's
  not an issue. Those packages will work fine with our template.
</p>

<p className='mb-5'>
  If you like to try you can install these packages in fresh CRA project without our template you will still get the
  same warnings.
</p>

### How to update logo and text

---

<p className='mb-5'>
  You can update the logo and text from <code>themeConfig.js</code> file. Please update these properties{' '}
  <code>app.appName</code> and <code>app.appLogoImage</code> to update the text and logo.
</p>

### Why we removed agGrid

---

<p>
  In our latest version we have removed agGrid. This is because agGrid was not completely free as it requires another
  purchase to get access to all of its features. Since{' '}
  <a href='https://reactstrap.github.io/components/tables/' target='_blank'>
    reactstrap
  </a>{' '}
  provides a decent table component and we have also added{' '}
  <a href='https://github.com/jbetancur/react-data-table-component' target='_blank'>
    react-data-table-component
  </a>{' '}
  (3rd party) package. it is easier to use them over agGrid and also you don't require any additional purchase.
</p>

<p className='mb-5'>
  So, we highly recommend you use{' '}
  <a href='https://reactstrap.github.io/components/tables/' target='_blank'>
    reactstrap
  </a>{' '}
  table component for your projects over any other table.
</p>

### Why we removed Data List

---

<p>
  We have removed data list in favour of more practical table UI and UX which you can find in{' '}
  <a href='https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-react-admin-dashboard-template/demo-1/apps/user/list' target='_blank'>
    user list
  </a>{' '}
  and{' '}
  <a href='https://pixinvent.com/demo/vuexy-react-admin-dashboard-template/demo-1/apps/invoice/list' target='_blank'>
    invoice list
  </a>
</p>

<p className='mb-5'>
  You can still keep using data list using old files but, as we have deprecated it we will not be able provide support
  for it.
</p>

### Why we removed Auth0 & Firebase

---

<p>
  We have removed both Auth0 & Firebase in our latest update as most developers prefer JWT & it was unmaintainable
  because with every new update of firebase code would break and it got messy for developers who don't need all three
  authentication methods.
</p>

### eCommerce Shop filter's not working

---

<p>
  We're using our own data with a fake database. Filtering on small size of data is not appropriate so we disabled
  filters and kept just UI.
</p>
