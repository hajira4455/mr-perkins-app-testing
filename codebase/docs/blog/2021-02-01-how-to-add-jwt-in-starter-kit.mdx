<p>
  Using JWT is easy. We have provided JWT folder for developers usage in full version <code>src/auth/jwt</code> copy
  that folder paste it in starter-kit.
</p>

<p>Now all you have to do is using it's jwt service:</p>

```jsx
import useJwt from '@src/auth/jwt/useJwt'

const LoginForm = () => {
  const handleSubmit = () => {
    useJwt
      .login({
        email: userEmail,
        password: userPassword
      })
      .then(() => {
        // Do something on success
      })
      .catch(() => {
        // Do something on error
      })
  }

  return <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>...</Form>
}
```

  This is same for register. You can use JWT helper methods like <code>setToken</code> as well.
</p>

<p>
  Certainly, if you have any configuration regrading JWT then you might have to modify it a little bit. Please check our
  docs on <a href='/docs/development/auth'>authentication</a>.
</p>
