<p>Here you will find how to use JWT authentication provided by our template.</p>

### JWT

---

<p>
  We provided JWT service for quickly getting started with authentication. It is also extendable so you can write your
  own JWT without removing ours or modify our JWT config.
</p>

<p>
  You can find our core JWT files in <code>src/@core/auth/jwt</code>. Let's understand what each file has to offer:
</p>

<ul className='mb-5'>
  <li>
    <strong>uswJwt.js:</strong> his file holds composition function <code>useJwt</code>. <code>useJwt</code> function
    accepts axios instance as first parameter and jwt config object as second parameter. It return instance of JWT
    service.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>jwtDefaultConfig.js:</strong> This file has default config we used in our template. Still, you can modify by
    passing your own config object in <code>useJwt</code> composition function.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>jwtService.js:</strong> This is actual JWT service which provides login, register, etc method for working
    with JWT.
  </li>
</ul>

### jwtService

---

<p>
  <code>jwtService.js</code> holds <code>JwtService</code> class which have several method and properties which we will
  explore below. You will get instance of this class when you use <code>useJwt</code> composition function
</p>

<h5 className='mb-3'>Axios response interceptor</h5>
<p className='mb-5'>
  We added axios response interceptor to auto renew JWT token once it get expired. We tried our best to provide this
  interceptor usable by almost all people. Still if you have any suggestions for us we are always ready for it. We love
  to improve our template and serve you better. ðŸ˜‡
</p>

### Using JWT Service

<p>
  Above mentioned JWT files are core files so please don't update them, you might break something if we provide the
  update. So, you can use composition function we provided to use JWT. You can find your JWT files in{' '}
  <code>src/auth/jwt</code>. In <code>useJwt.js</code> file instead of passing blank object you can pass your own config
  to configure JWT service. You can refer to default config to check which options are available to override.
</p>

<p>We haven't provided config for storing user data because it is up to you how to save user data.</p>

<p className='mb-5'>
  You will also find auth utils in <code>src/auth/utils.js</code> file. Those utils are well commented and self
  explanatory as well.
</p>

### Overriding Jwt Service

<p>
  Certainly, you might not want to use localStorage to save token as it is not much secure and you want to use cookies
  instead. In this case you can use our class to create your own JWT service and use that.
</p>
