<p>Understand folder structure of template and what everything contains</p>

### Overview

---

<p>Before checking folder structure it is better you know some stuff related to folder structure.</p>

<ul className='mb-3'>
  <li>
    <code>@core</code> folder contains core files of template which <strong>should not be modified</strong> unless our
    support team guide you to do it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Outside of <code>@core</code> folder are files you can move and modify as your wish. Basically that is your
    playground where you can modify anything.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>@core</code> folder contains layouts and styles but those are core files so you can still write your our
    layout using our layout and override our styles.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>@fake-db</code> folder just contains dummy data which we get in response of API call. This enables us to take
    step forward in providing API ready template.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>/src/layouts</code> older outside of <code>@core</code> is your layouts which you can modify however you like.
    Template will render this layouts.
  </li>
</ul>

### @core folder

---

<p>
  <code>@core</code> folder is core of our template which includes core files like layouts, custom components, assets,
  etc.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>@core folder isn't meant to be modified</strong> When you will update of our template replacing this @core
  folder will hopefully update the template with minimum changes. This is improvement over our old structure which will
  ease your update process.
</p>

<p>
  It's good idea to have a look at it and know what it contains to use stuff we already invented so{' '}
  <strong>you don't have to reinvent the wheel</strong>.
</p>

<p>e.g. we have customized Wizard component which make 3rd party component bs-stepper easy to use.</p>
