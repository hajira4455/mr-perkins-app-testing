<p>Vuexy provides splash screen for heavy projects which requires more time to load. </p>

### Usage

---

<p>
  Splash screen is shown using React's <code>&lt;suspense&gt;</code> component. You can read about suspense component{' '}
  <a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html' target='_blank'>
    here
  </a>
</p>
<p>Splash screen is already included in full version and starter-kit so you don't have to include it separately.</p>

### Customization

---

<p>There are two splash screen fallbacks the first one is for the main App and second is for the content.</p>

<p>Let see how to change both of them.</p>

<ol className='pl-3'>
  <li>
    <strong>Main App</strong>: Navigate to <code>src/index.js</code> import your loader and replace ours with yours in{' '}
    <code>fallback</code> prop.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Content</strong>: Navigate to <code>src/router/Router.js</code> import your loader and replace null in{' '}
    <code>ResolveRoutes</code> with yours in <code>fallback</code> prop.
  </li>
</ol>
