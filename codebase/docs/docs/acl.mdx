import { Alert } from 'reactstrap'

<p>In this page you will understand usage of ACL in our template and how you can use it.</p>

### Overview

---

<p>
  Unlike previous version of Vuexy, new Vuexy uses CASL package for providing access control. Which is future oriented
  and is more detailed on Access Control.
</p>

<p>
  You can find docs for CASL{' '}
  <a href='https://casl.js.org/v4/en/guide/intro' target='_blank'>
    here
  </a>
  .
</p>

<p className='mb-5'>
  CASL may look complex at first so please make sure you first read their docs carefully and understand base logic of
  Access Control to proceed further.
</p>

### ACL Flow

---

<p>
  You can find CASL configuration in <code>src/configs/acl</code> folder.
</p>
<p>
  We've also created a <code>Can</code> context to verify user abilities. You can find the context in{' '}
  <code>src/utility/Can.js</code>
</p>
<p>Let's explore ACL related files:</p>

<ul className='pl-3'>
  <li>
    <strong>ability.js</strong>: This file exports ACL ability
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>initialAbility.js</strong>: This file exports users initial ability.
  </li>
</ul>

<Alert className='my-5' color='warning'>
  <h4 className='alert-heading'>Warning</h4>
  <div className='alert-body'>
    Files might get updated/moved/removed in future updates to make structure more minimal and clutter free.
  </div>
</Alert>

<h5 className='mb-3'>ability.js</h5>
<p>
  It imports <code>initialAbility</code> & exports current user's ability. If user is not logged in or user's ability
  isn't retrieved from localStorage then it uses <code>initialAbility</code> defined in <code>initialAbility.js</code>{' '}
  file.
</p>
<p className='mb-5'>
  Once user logs in ability is updated using <code>ability.update(newAbility)</code> from <code>Can</code> Context.
  Sample newAbility array:
</p>

```js
newAbility: [
  {
    action: 'read',
    subject: 'User'
  }
]
```

<p className='my-4'>
  Also, this same ability is stored in user's object <code>userData</code> in localStorage under <code>ability</code>{' '}
  property.
</p>

```js
// User data stored in localStorage
// Key Name: userData

{
  id: 1,
  fullName: "John Doe",
  username: "johndoe",
  avatar: "/img/13-small.d796bffd.png",
  email: "admin@demo.com",
  ability: [
    {
      action: "manage",
      subject: "all"
    }
  ],
  // more...
}
```

<Alert className='my-5' color='info'>
  <h4 className='alert-heading'>Info</h4>
  <div className='alert-body'>
    We are getting user ability on refresh from <code>userData</code> which is stored in localStorage. We have stored
    ability in <code>userData.ability</code>. If you have different approach for storing and retrieving ability then
    please update <code>src/configs/acl/ability.js</code> file.
  </div>
</Alert>

### Route Protection

---

<p>
  You can protect your route from being visited by other users through as well. We already configured{' '}
  <code>FinalRoute</code>
  function in router to redirect user to not authorized page if user don't have ability for that route. All you have to do
  is use route meta to define user ability.
</p>

```js
{
  path: '/access-control',
  component: lazy(() => import('../../views/extensions/access-control')),
  meta: {
    action: 'read',
    resource: 'ACL'
  }
}
```

<p className='mt-3'>
  Here, resource refers to subject in CASL{' '}
  <a href='https://casl.js.org/v4/en/guide/intro#basics' target='_blank'>
    docs
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  Once you define ability for route using meta, if user don't have defined ability for visiting route then it will be
  redirected to not authorized page.
</p>

<p className='mb-5'>
  If user is not logged in and try to visit the route with ability which user don't have then user will get redirected
  to login page instead of not authorized page.
</p>

### Omitting Defining `resource` and `action` for route

---

<p>If you do not define resource and action then only user with below ability will be able to visit the route:</p>

```js
{
  action: 'manage',
  subject: 'all'
}
```

<Alert className='my-3' color='success'>
  <h4 className='alert-heading'>Tip</h4>
  <div className='alert-body'>
    <code>manage</code> and <code>all</code> are special keywords in CASL. <code>manage</code> represents any action and
    <code>all</code> represents any subject.
  </div>
</Alert>

<p>
  So, in your project if you don't have any user with above mentioned ability and you don't define <code>action</code>{' '}
  and <code>resource</code>
  for route then no one will be able to visit that route ever.
</p>

<Alert className='mb-5' color='info'>
  <h4 className='alert-heading'>Info</h4>
  <div className='alert-body'>
    We have user (Admin user) with above mentioned ability in our demo. That's why we don't have to write{' '}
    <code>action</code> and
    <code>resource</code> on each route.
  </div>
</Alert>

### Show/Hide Navigation Items

---

<p>Besides route protection you can also show/hide navigation items based on user ability.</p>

<p>Besides existing options provided by navigation items there's two more option you can specify if you use ACL.</p>

<ul className='pl-3'>
  <li>
    <strong>resource</strong>: This refers to subject in CASL docs
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>action</strong>: This is action for ability.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Add these two options in your navigation item to show/hide navigation items based on user ability.</p>

<h5 className='mb-3'>Omitting defining resource and action for groups</h5>
<p>
  You can optionally define <code>resource</code> & <code>action</code> on navigation item type which have children:
</p>

<ul className='pl-3'>
  <li>Vertical Navigation Menu Group</li>
  <li>Horizontal Navigation Menu Group</li>
  <li>Horizontal Navigation Menu Header Group</li>
</ul>

<p>
  e.g. If you have vertical navigation menu group and your provided both options for every group child and you want to
  hide group if all it's child don't have ability then don't worry about adding both option in menu group options. We
  already handled hiding group if none of it's child is visible. Means, We will hide group if there's no child to render
  due to lack of ability.
</p>

```jsx
/** Both group child have `resource` and `action` defined
   * So, If I omit defining `resource` and `action` for group
   * => then group will be hidden if both child are hidden
   * Conclusion: You can omit defining `resource` and `action` for group if you want this kind of behavior
*/
{
    id: 'access-control',
    title: 'Access Control',
    icon: <Shield size={12} />,
    action: 'read',
    resource: 'ACL',
    navLink: '/access-control'
  }
```

<h5 className='my-3'>Group & ACL scenarios</h5>

<Alert color='info'>
  <h4 className='alert-heading'>NOTE</h4>
  <div className='alert-body'>
    "can be viewed" means ACL ability is resolved to true and user can view it. "hidden" means ACL ability is resolved
    to false and user can't view it.
  </div>
</Alert>

<p>Please note this scenarios apply to all three group types of navigation item:</p>

<ul className='pl-3'>
  <li>Vertical Navigation Menu Group</li>
  <li>Horizontal Navigation Menu Group</li>
  <li>Horizontal Navigation Menu Header Group</li>
</ul>
