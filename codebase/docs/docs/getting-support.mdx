  resolved quickly please follow below guide:
</p>
<h5 className='mb-3'>Finding existing solution</h5>
<p>
  There might be case that you issue is already resolved and you are the one who is facing due to some issue. So before
  creating new support ticket please search it in our <a href='/faq'>FAQ page</a> where we listed most common
  questions/issues asked in our support portal.
</p>
<h5 className='mt-5 mb-3'>Ticket Type</h5>
<p>
  Add ticket type to your ticket title to let community understand what your ticket is about. This also helps to find
  related tickets using ticket type.
</p>
<p>
  So, your ticket till will be like <code>[question] how to change theme?</code>
</p>
<p>Some common ticket types are listed below:</p>
<ul className='pl-3'>
  <li>
    <strong>question</strong> - If you are asking question
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>installation</strong> - If you have anything related to installation
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>auth</strong> - If you have anything related to JWT or Auth
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>acl</strong> - If you have anything related to Access Control
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>feat-req</strong> - If you have any feature request for our template
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>bug</strong> - If you find any bug in template
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>other</strong> - if your ticket doesn't related to above mentioned ticket types
  </li>
</ul>

<ul className='pl-3'>
  <li>[question] How to change theme?</li>
  <li>[question] How to change i18n locale?</li>

  <li>[auth] I get redirected to login page even after login on refresh</li>
</ul>
<h5 className='mt-5 mb-3'>New Issue - New ticket</h5>
<p>
  Following above suggestion, it will be good if you create another support ticket if you have any other question/issue
  which is not related to your current ticket.
</p>
<p>

  to close installation ticket and open another ticket for that component to make support portal more accurate and easy
  find place.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to show us some code it will be better if you can format it properly and use code block so your pasted
  code get highlighted.
</p>
<h5 className='mt-5 mb-3'>Reproducing Issue/Bug - Starter-kit</h5>
<p>
  If you have ticket where we need to have a look at your code like some component's certain feature is working in our
  live demo but not in your downloaded package then it will better you give us actual issue or reproduction steps.
</p>
<p>
  Best solution for this is using our Starter-kit where we can test it without any dependency. This will also help you
  to clear your issue before sending it to us.
</p>
