  Change template to fit your needs. To configure template we will use <code>themeConfig.js</code> file, which have all
  template configurations listed with their valid values.
</p>

### Using themeConfig.js

---

<p>
  <code>$themeConfig</code> This is the file where you can update template behavior.
</p>

<p className='mb-5'>
  <code>$themeConfig</code> object options and it's valid values are already listed there. Hence, it is self
  explanatory. Just changed configuration as your requirement and you are done.
</p>

### Accessing theme colors in JS files

---

<p>
  We've created a ThemeColors context to make it accessible in every component. You can use <code>useContext</code> hook
  to get <code>themeColors</code> object anywhere in your app. You can find Theme Context in{' '}
  <code>src/utility/context/ThemeColors</code>
</p>

<p>Usage Example:</p>

```jsx
import { useContext } from 'react'
import { ThemeColors } from '@src/utility/context/ThemeColors'

const { colors } = useContext(ThemeColors)

console.log(colors)
```

### Changing theme colors

---

<p>
  To update template colors just update bootstrap color variables in:{' '}
  <code>src/assets/scss/variables/_variables.scss</code>
</p>

```scss title="_variables.scss"
$primary: #00cfe8; // Changing primary color
```
